# Veritas

A real-time misinformation-free intelligence platform that constructs a branching timeline of truth for global events.

## What We're Building

When major news breaks — pandemics, conflicts, or elections — Veritas gathers information from thousands of live sources, detects where stories diverge, and presents those branches visually. Each branch carries a credibility score, grounded in source reliability, cross-verification, and factual consensus.

### Veritas Makes Truth Explorable

- **Source Profiling** assigns every outlet a credibility and bias score, helping users see who's trustworthy and who isn't.
- **Cross-lingual Normalization** merges equivalent claims across languages into unified nodes, preventing misinformation silos.
- **Theme Evolution & Playback** lets users replay how a narrative formed, mutated, and got resolved over time.

### Interactive Explanations

Make complex news accessible:

- **Explain Like I'm Five** → simplifies the event for general audiences.
- **Expert Lens** → provides a rigorous, source-linked breakdown for journalists or analysts.

## News Sources

Veritas will rely primarily on the following 4 types of news sources:

### 1. Social Media Streams (High noise, fast signals)
**These are where misinformation emerges first.**

### 2. News and Media Outlets (Moderate reliability, essential for verification)

### 3. Official Data Sources (High reliability, low frequency)
Used to verify factual claims during crises.

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Government APIs / portals | WHO, UN, MoHFW (India), IPCC datasets |
| Government social media pages | GovIndia, POTUS twitter accounts |
| NGO dashboards | World Bank, Our World in Data |

**Agentic behavior:** Cross-reference specific quantitative claims (e.g., "X number of deaths", "Y% infection rate") against structured data.

### 4. Community / Crowd Submissions (Optional, high recall)
Allow citizens, journalists, or NGOs to submit claims they encounter. This is only by those with a very high reliability score on their Veritas profile.

## Vision

Veritas ultimately becomes the world's truth interface — a transparent, multilingual system that visualizes how information spreads, fractures, and converges. In a world of noise and confusion, it restores clarity, accountability, and informed understanding.

## Specific Pain Points It Addresses

### Information Overload & Fragmentation
During crises, millions of posts, articles, and videos flood the internet — most unverified or conflicting. Veritas cuts through this noise by aggregating diverse data into a single, transparent timeline that visually distinguishes verified facts from speculation.

### Lack of Context & Clarity
Traditional news feeds show updates, not understanding. Veritas adds context layers — showing how, when, and why narratives diverged — allowing users to see the information history behind every claim.

### Misinformation Across Languages
False narratives often spread independently across language communities. Veritas' multilingual engine unifies semantically equivalent claims, ensuring debunked misinformation in one language doesn't continue unchecked elsewhere.

### Erosion of Trust in Media
With AI-generated content and partisan bias, audiences struggle to identify credible sources. Veritas restores transparency through source profiling — measurable credibility, bias, and historical accuracy scores.

### Limited Accessibility for Non-Experts
Most fact-checking platforms target experts. Veritas bridges the gap with "Explain Like I'm Five" and "Expert Lens" modes — making accurate, contextual information accessible to everyone from students to policy analysts.

## Target Audience

**Everyday People:** Anyone who wants to stay informed about global or local events without being misled.

**Key Principle:** Veritas presents verified facts, not opinions, so users can learn what happened and draw their own conclusions.
